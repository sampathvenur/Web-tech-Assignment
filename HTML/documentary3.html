        <h1>Exploring CSS and Image Mapping</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Sampath's documentary on CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Image Mapping. Let's delve into these
            fascinating topics!</p>
        <h2>Understanding CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style the presentation of a web page written in
            HTML or XML. It allows web designers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a
            website. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them.</p>
        <p>Key features of CSS include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selectors: Identify which HTML elements to style.</li>
            <li>Properties: Define the visual characteristics of selected elements.</li>
            <li>Values: Specify the settings for the chosen properties.</li>
            <li>Cascading: The order of style application, which allows for inheritance and overriding of styles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With CSS, web developers can create visually appealing and responsive websites that adapt to various screen
            sizes and devices.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Image Mapping</h2>
        <p>Image mapping is a technique used in web design to make specific regions of an image clickable, linking to
            different destinations. This allows for the creation of interactive images where users can navigate to
            different pages or trigger actions by clicking on different parts of the image.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of image maps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-Side Image Maps: These are defined using HTML `<map>` and `<area>` elements, with coordinates
                    specified in pixels. They are processed by the client's browser.</li>
            <li>Server-Side Image Maps: These are defined using CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts on the server,
                which process the user's click and redirect them accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Image mapping is commonly used in website navigation, interactive diagrams, and multimedia presentations,
            enhancing user engagement and interactivity.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/images/documentary3.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
        </div>
        <p>Image mapping can be visually represented like the image above, where different regions of the image are
            defined as clickable areas.</p>
